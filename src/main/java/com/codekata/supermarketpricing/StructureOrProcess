We have 3 main problems here
1. three for a dollar (so whatâ€™s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
2. $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
3. buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)

for the first and third problem we will be needing a price calculator which will calculate the price before promotion and after promotion
So for this I created two interfaces with name caluclator and converter so in future if we need to convert into anyother we can just implement new method
There can be different promotion type we need to create promotion interface which can carry different type of promotions
We will be needing a factory method which will map the promotion to its type
